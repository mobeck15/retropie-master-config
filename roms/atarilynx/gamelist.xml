Surrounding this castle is a wall, made up of small blocks, completely surrounding a region of the board. This area is considered the player's territory, and it may contain one or more castles, and any number of cannons. The maintenance of this territory is the primary focus of the game. Once the player defeats the opponent, the player can execute the commander, by walking the plank or beheading.</desc>

Reception[edit]
Computer Gaming World criticized the game for only displaying about 10% of the field at a time without a "radar" screen to show the rest, but liked the animation. The magazine concluded that "World Class Soccer should prove an informative and reasonably entertaining way to prepare for the event".[2]</desc>

		<name>Bubble Trouble</name>
		<desc>You are Travis, a scientist doing experiments with dense matter for the creation of artificial black holes for interstellar travel. While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble.

You move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal "Burst!!!", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is "Use scanner". This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles. Once you locate and gather all the particles needed in the level, you move on to the next level. After you finish five levels, you win the game.</desc>

		<name>QIX</name>
		<desc>The objective of Qix is to fence off, or “claim”, a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.

The player controls a Stix that can move around the edges of the rectangle. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to move into unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. If completed, the captured area (defined as the side opposite of where the Qix is) becomes filled in with a solid color and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% of the playfield (adjustable by the arcade operator to be between 50% and 90%).

The player's marker can move at two different speeds; areas drawn exclusively at the slower speed (orange-red on the screenshot shown) are worth double points. It cannot cross or backtrack along a line in progress.

A life is lost if the Qix touches a line as it is being drawn or if the marker is touched by any of the Sparx – enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted lines. In addition, if the marker stops while drawing a line, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves the marker again. The player has no defenses against the enemies and must out-maneuver them in order to survive.

A meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx, and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx which can chase the player up an uncompleted line.

After the player completes two levels, the difficulty increases by the inclusion of multiple Qixes, additional Sparx, speed increases, and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx. In levels with multiple Qixes, the player can also complete the level by splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing at least one Qix.</desc>

However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade, Sega and Atari Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off; however, the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally. For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as a bonus.</desc>

		<name>Robotron: 2084</name>
		<desc>Robotron: 2084 (also referred to as Robotron) is an arcade video game developed by Vid Kidz and released by Williams Electronics (part of WMS Industries) in 1982. It is a shoot 'em up with two-dimensional graphics. The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots have turned against humans in a cybernetic revolt. The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots, rescue surviving humans, and earn as many points as possible.

Robotron popularized the twin joystick control scheme, one that had previously been used in Taito's Space Dungeon.

Robotron: 2084 was critically and commercially successful. Praise among critics focused on the game's intense action and control scheme. The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry. Robotron: 2084 arcade cabinets have since become a sought-after collector's item. It was ported to numerous platforms.</desc>

		<name>Rygar: Legendary Warrior</name>
		<desc>The arcade game begins with the following introduction:

4.5 billion years have passed since Earth's creation. Many dominators have ruled in all their glory, but time was their greatest enemy and it defeated their reign. And now a new dominator's reign begins...

Information gleaned from console manuals reveals that the evil being Ligar has taken over the land of Argool, and Rygar, a dead warrior who has risen from his grave, must use his Diskarmor, along with a variety of other weapons, to stop him. In console versions clues and limited dialogue are given in the form of large, sage-like men encountered in stone green temples throughout the game.

In the Japanese original, references to "Ligar" and "Rygar" are one and the same because the Roman syllables "Li" and "Ry" come from the same Japanese character. In this version, the hero is only referred to as "The Legendary Warrior", while both "Rygar" and "Ligar" refer to the main villain.

The Atari Lynx version closely followed the arcade version. However, the layout of some rounds was different, and there were only 23 rounds.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform video game produced by Reflections and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples.

Shadow of the Beast was followed by two sequels, Shadow of the Beast II in 1990 and Shadow of the Beast III in 1992 . A remake is in development for the PlayStation 4.

A man named Aarbron is kidnapped as a child and corrupted through magic into a monstrous warrior-servant for the evil beast lord Maletoth. The creature's memory of his human life returns when he watches a man being executed, whom he later recognizes as his father. This prompts Aarbron to seek revenge on Maletoth.</desc>

T-TRIS, a version of Tetris for the Atari Lynx. If you've been living in a
cave for the last ten years, Tetris is a game where oddly-shaped blocks
fall from the top of the screen as the player rotates and positions them.
Solid rows of blocks vanish to make room for more, and the pieces fall
faster as time progresses. The game ends when there's no more room in the

		<desc>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu伝説?) is a 1989 shoot 'em up platformer arcade game, or a "run and gun" developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It was designed by Akira Sakuma and features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth. The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on the title protagonist; thereby transforming him from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.

Due to its popularity, within the next two years the game was ported to a larger number of home video game consoles and home computers of the time. Ocean Software published versions for the Amiga and Atari ST versions, They also advertised versions for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC and the Spectrum version was previewed in issue 90 of Crash Magazine, but neither port materialized. Taito published ports for the Atari Lynx and the Nintendo Entertainment System. The latter version of the game was slightly altered and featured a health bar so that Toki didn't die after one hit.

Sega would later reprogram and retool the game into an exclusive version for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis known as Toki: Going Ape Spit. This version lacks the non-spit power-ups, but it features additional levels and more detailed graphics.

A new, independent enhanced remake was announced in October 2009. It is being developed by Golgoth Studio and targeted for release on PC via Steam and on home consoles through XBLA, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare. It was originally planned for a 2011 release, but it's still unreleased as of 2015, even if it was approved on Steam Greenlight at the end of 2013.</desc>
