		<desc>Army Men is a mission-based combat game that has you guiding a green plastic commando named Sarge in warfare against a tan-colored toy army. Soldiers use bazookas, grenades, flamethrowers, mortars, automatic rifles, and land mines to trash each other. You can also drive jeeps and tanks across the varied terrain. To help you learn the controls, a boot camp option offers a series of eight training missions. 

Once you are ready, choose from two campaigns: desert and alpine. Review your objectives before each mission on the briefing screen, and prepare for battle against an onslaught of plastic troops. A mission will fail if you exceed the time limit, allow your rivals to win, or let Sarge die. The options screen lets you view current objectives, consult a strategic map, exit vehicles, and abort your mission. You can also adjust the control scheme, select a difficulty level, and toggle music.</desc>

If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

		<desc>Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: A Board Game Adventure packs the personality and fun of the popular Disney characters into a wild board game filled with a variety of mini-games. Select your favorite BEAUTY AND THE BEAST character and play against three opponents as you race to the finish line. Since everything depends on the roll of the dice, there is a bit of luck involved but skill enters into the mix when you land on one of the mini-game squares. When you do, you'll be whisked to one of 10 side games that will test your reflexes, memory, and skill. Up to four players can play this game by passing the system around after each turn no link cable required! If you want to try something a little different when playing by yourself, challenge the game's Story mode, where you must race the villainous Gaston to the finish of each board.</desc>

When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma's dastardly minions will be after you, but you'll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you'll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There'll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that's rightfully yours. Good luck, llama!</desc>

		<desc>A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

		<desc>Is Game Boy Color man enough to handle Duke? You'd better believe it.

The master of one-liners and undisputed king of carnage has conquered Nintendo 64, and now he's preparing to get down and dirty on Game Boy Color. The most recent Duke Nukem titles have been played using a first-person perspective, but GT Interactive broke that pattern with Zero Hour for the N64, and this platform adventure for Game Boy Color. Duke's ego must be growing out of control now that millions of gamers will actually be able to admire his pumped-up pecs while playing.

Duke Nukem delivers 16 levels of alien annihilation, with a different visual theme for each area. Duke is equipped with all new moves for his small screen debut, including a perfect backflip which leads us to believe that he may have been dating a gymnast in the off-season.

Duke Nukem is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

All's fair in love and corporate lumberjack matches, though, so Acclaim pulled itself off the canvas and went out in search of a new franchise. The answer lay as close as the nearest TV, where Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) holds court weekly on The Nashville Network.

Technology has progressed to the point that air-based nuclear attacks are ineffective, so warfare will be conducted the old-fashioned way: through large-scaled attacks of armored units and infantry. In this one-player strategy or action game, you'll choose to either control the American or the Chinese military forces, each side comprised of the same eight different unit types. From the speed and power of a tactical helicopter attack to the all-out brawn of a platoon of tanks, you'll have all the warfare options you'll need to carry out your plan of attack. In order to complete the game, you'll have to battle your way through 16 different missions that take place all over the world, in such locations as barren snowfields, yawning deserts, and crowded cityscapes.</desc>

		<desc>Did you ever wonder what it would be like to work construction? More importantly, did you ever want to drive one of those really big Caterpillar trucks? Now you can live out your fantasies with Matchbox Caterpillar Construction Zone. You will get to drive 11 different Caterpillar trucks including Track Type Tractor, Integrated Toolcarrier, Articulated Truck, Challenger Agricultural Tractor, Lexicon Combine, Log Skidder, Wheel Loader, Paver and Backhoe Loader. In each level, you are given a construction task to complete, such as building a pool or repairing a road. Luckily, George, the construction foreman gives you guidance. If you listen to him, you should be able to build everything in Matchbox Caterpillar Construction Zone.</desc>

		<sortname>Flintstones BurgerTime in Bedrock</sortname>
		<desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

		<desc>Travel back to prehistoric times, with Disney's DINOSAUR for the Game Boy Color. Loosely based on the computer-animated feature film, players will have to guide Aladar the Iguanadon, Zini the Lemur, and Flia the Pteranodon through 12 different levels, using each of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Aladar's strength and brute force are great assets, but there are times when the smaller, quicker Zini will need to take over. Neither of them will do you any good if a situation calls for the ability to fly, though so it's a good thing Flia is with you on this adventure. Learning to use each of these characters to overcome obstacles is the key to avoiding extinction! With video taken directly from the film and an encyclopedia covering all the creatures in the game, Disney's DINOSAUR will immerse players in a world that existed millions of years ago.</desc>

In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne's world as "hunny"). In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger's collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you'll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.</desc>

		<desc>To coincide with the release of another Little Mermaid video, Disney has also released another Little Mermaid videogame. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.</desc>

The game begins with the receipt of an acceptance letter into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. From there, you (as Harry Potter, of course) will go shopping for your school supplies, catch the train on the 9 3/4 platform, take a boat ride, and finally arrive at your new home.</desc>

		<desc>The third entry in the down-home series of RPGs boasts a bevy of new options and features. You can play as a male or female farmer, get married, play with new pets and enjoy new minigames.

Essentially a farming role-playing game, Harvest Moon 3 requires you to clear a patch of land, till the soil, plant seeds and tend the new shoots. Take a twice-weekly ferry to the mainland (the island locale is new to this game) to purchase animals and other supplies.

Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the lack of swordplay, magic spells and other traditional RPG fare, the Harvest Moon series exerts its own unique charm that has won over thousands of would-be farmers worldwide.</desc>

To do this, you must till the soil and cultivate vegetables. When you have earned enough money, you can add chickens and livestock to help increase your profits. While you work, you will receive visits from the local townsfolk, who will ask for your help. You should always help them as much as possible, because they will be willing to return the favor later. Once you have built your ranch to a significant level, you can trade it with other farm masters via link cable. Try to restore the family ranch in HARVEST MOON.</desc>

Jealous of the sky's wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night's stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night's sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don't control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.</desc>

		<desc>LOGICAL adds a distinctive puzzle game experience to the Game Boy Color. Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

		<name>Metal Walker</name>
		<desc>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.

Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</desc>

		<desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

Lording over the game halls in the days after PAC-MAN and DONKEY KONG had lost their luster, these two giants revolutionized gaming forever. JOUST casts you in the role of a noble knight from the future mounting you on an ostrich and sending you off into battle. Making full use of the ostrich, you'll try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot's seat of an aerodynamic space ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege. You'll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do battle with a friend.</desc>

		<desc>The rogue leader General Reznick has threatened to attack the United States with an arsenal of nuclear weapons. In addition, he has kidnapped several UN weapons inspectors. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take control of Ethan Hunt, infiltrate General Reznick's base, rescue the weapons inspectors, and destroy the nuclear arsenal. This may sound impossible, but Hunt has a number of resources available to him including keys, guns, cameras, and a grappling hook. But, Ethan's greatest weapon is stealth. By staying out of sight and not killing the guards, Ethan can earn stealth points that can be translated into additional lives. Will Ethan be able to survive 10 terrorist-filled levels? Only if he uses all of his skills in MISSION: Impossible.</desc>

		<name>Monster Rancher Battle Card GB</name>
		<desc>Before the world's continents broke up into pieces, a huge disaster hit the world. People prayed to God for help, and God created new life forms. However, new life forms brought new troubles, so God became exasperated and sealed them in "disc stones". Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of "disc stones". Today people still continue searching for these missing "disc stones" to unlock the lifeforms within. In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists.
It is said that the "disc stones" are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began. As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world. Now ranchers across the globe come together and enter unto battle.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

You control Harry as he battles through 15 levels that span jungles, volcanoes, prisons, and caverns. Each world has unique variations; for example, you have to swing from vines in the jungle stages, while using a pickaxe to battle scorpions and other monsters. For some additional help, Harry has quick reflexes to allow him to dodge bullets and jump over some of the bad guys. In addition to Harry's innate skills, there are power-ups scattered throughout the levels including extra lives, gold bars, crystals, and extra health. Help Harry restore peace to the jungle in PITFALL: Beyond the Jungle.</desc>

		<name>Planet of the Apes</name>
		<desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.</desc>

		<desc>There are two tables in the game, red and blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.

Each table has different "locations" that you play, which determine which Pokémon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.

"Catch Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokémon. Once you activate "catch mode," you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.

"Evolution Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.</desc>

You venture around the town in which you live on an overworld map where you can go to different locations. Once you arrive at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue. More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging you to a fight. After you are challenged by a character, the game switches to a one-on-one fighting game engine. This is the RPG's battle system which differs from the usual turn-based battle engine's of the genre.
You can buy new parts for your Model which is how you gain experience throughout the game. You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered. Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character.</desc>

Our only chance is for a single pilot in a lone R-Type fighter to penetrate the Bydo defense system and destroy the evil Empire before it can launch its attack. Tear through Bydo defenses as you blast enemies with your Fire Chain, Super Laser and Bubble Beam. Take the fight to a fevered pitch with two pulse-pounding rapid-fire modes on your Game Boy Color system.</desc>

		<desc>Giant monsters are attacking the world's cities and you just happen to be one of the monsters. You can choose from six different beasts, including a gorilla, wolf, rat, lizard, lobster, and rhino. Each character has unique strengths and weaknesses, plus a unique special attack. Earn points by demolishing all of the buildings, downing helicopters, destroying tanks, and eating the helpless citizens. When you are hit by the human defenses, you lose power from your life meter. As luck would have it, health power-ups are located in each level, including a special food for each character that boosts their abilities. There are 100 cities to destroy, along with a Two-Player option that allows a friend to join the destructive action. Send the human race back to the Stone Age with RAMPAGE 2: Universal Tour.</desc>

		<desc>Purebred destruction is the name of the game in RAMPAGE WORLD TOUR. Choose one of three different monsters (each a gargantuan tower of rage), and then join your counterparts as you wreak holy terror on city after city. You'll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game's focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there's little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay. If you're familiar with the RAMPAGE series, you'll love the inclusion of three new monsters to take the place of the familiar faces from the original game. The play is faithful to previous titles in the RAMPAGE series, but improved graphics and controls make for the most exhilarating entry to date. Devastation has never been so fun!</desc>

You choose to play as Chris (a cat) or Betty (a little bird), and then take your character through a slew of puzzles, avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. Finding the appropriate items will allow you to jump across furniture, shrink your car, or even climb over your obstacles. Smart strategy and quick reflexes will help you unlock an extremely trying boss level where you'll take on either a cat or bird in a head-to-head duel.

There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid's games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone's skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed. Now you can help a young gamer get started with RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy.</desc>

Join up with the entire gang of meddling kids (Shaggy, Scooby, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) as you try to crack three separate mysteries each based on classic episodes of the beloved cartoon program. Taking the TV episodes "What a Night for a Knight," "That's Snow Ghost," and "A Tiki Scare is No Fair," the game runs the three stories together with a unifying plotline. You play as Shaggy, trudging through haunted forests, creepy basements, and abandoned buildings with your trusty pal, Scoob. Rather than having a "death" meter, as in most games of its kind, SCOOBY-DOO: Classic Creep Capers has a courage meter Scoob and Shag flee the scene if they get too scared. There are plenty of clues hidden throughout the game's expansive levels, but if you're not careful the bad guys might get to you before you can solve the mysteries. While the game certainly offers something for nostalgic fans of the series, it's a hilarious, original take that will keep gamers challenged as well.</desc>

		<desc>The wackiest computer-animated film of all time has its own classic hand-held game! Boasting fast-paced thrills and the most hilarious characters ever portrayed in a video game, SHREK: Fairy Tales Freakdown turns the story of the movie into a fighting game that players of all ages will love. Taking six familiar faces from the popular film, Fairy Tales Freakdown pits the unlikely combatants in a series of battles against one another each fight taking place in a classic SHREK environment. Solid gameplay will earn you the right to play as one of three locked characters, and each brawler is characterized by a unique (and highly comical) fighting style. The mostly non-violent fighting closely mirrors the humor of the film, resulting in some truly memorable melees. Using animations that are straight from the film, the game delivers the look and feel that made SHREK so successful. Play alone or take on a friend in this lighthearted, tournament-style fighting game.</desc>

		<desc>The game design of the Game Boy Color edition of Star Wars Episode I: Racer is loosely based on the Nintendo 64 version. The game still takes place over multiple planets in the Star Wars universe -- the deserts of Tatooine, the ice tracks of Ando Prime, and swamps of Baroonda. You take control of Anakin and try and defeat your "rival" on each of the game's tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track's "rival" alien and his pod racer -- and each alien's Pod Racer controls and drives differently. The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature -- but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it's only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds.</desc>

		<desc>First, it was a beloved book, then it was an animated special, next it was a movie, and now Dr. Seuss' HOW THE GRINCH STTOLE CHRISTMAS is a hand-held video game. You play both the Grinch and his faithful pooch, Max, in this creative adaptation. Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you're a genuine grouch or you're just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.</desc>

For example, soda cans are weapons that can be hurled at obstacles to destroy them, patches allow you to recover from collisions, and beach balls grant invulnerability. Figuring out when to use these items is part of the challenge, as you race down 27 different rivers of varying difficulty. Fans of the arcade classic have something to cheer about, now that TOOBIN' can be in the palm of their hand.</desc>

Wanting to test them, he has Phil (a gentle Frankenstein-type monster) put them all on. Unfortunately, the combination of all four inventions causes Phil to explode. You must guide Igor through 15 levels as he searches for all of Phil's parts, as well as all four of his inventions to complete the quest. However, getting through the levels is no walk in the park, as enemies lurk behind every corner. Fortunately, there are plenty of weapons to collect and throw at them.

		<desc>The popularity of the original film lives on, and thus an update on the time-honored story. The movie that rocketed Tom Cruise's popularity to its height makes for an excellent game, as TOP GUN: Firestorm is packed with the dogfights, strategy, and interpersonal tensions that made its source material so cool. You'll pilot an F-14 Tomcat through many levels of training, fighting, and trick flying. The four different terrain types provide a wide variety of unique challenges for would-be aces, and the collection of enemy fighters is mighty, to say the very least. There are 12 missions in all, and each one will require a different skill set and all of the weapons you can get your hands on. Making the most of its access to full-color graphics, this GBC take on the game boasts incredible animations and detailed terrain from takeoff to landing and everywhere in-between. Whether you're a fan of old action movies or you're just looking for an exciting game, this one's a major score.</desc>

In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

Play continues until one player is left standing. In both modes, you can play against up to three computer-controlled opponents. You can also play a single human opponent via a link cable.

Well, then you might just be ready for the most extreme three-on-three action that videogaming has ever seen. In the bold tradition of arcade classics like NBA JAM, NBA HOOPZ focuses on totally unrealistic, terrifically acrobatic basketball.

There are no complicated plays or boring rules to hold you back do what you have to do to wrestle the ball away from the other team and put it in the hole. Shaquille O'Neal takes the spotlight in this one, but there are plenty of other NBA stars to play as (though some need to be unlocked by winning games). Choose which players you want to play on your NBA franchise, then jump it up and see who's the best. Other than the regular gameplay, you can try your hand at 2-Ball, Around the World, Twenty-One, and the Three-Pont Shootout.</desc>

The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one's doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It's still regarded as one of the greats. The GBC version, released in 2000, is a direct port of the NES game.</desc>

Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</desc>

		<desc>In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row. When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear. Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into place next to each other. It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy. In the game's Challenge mode, for example, you're up against a computer opponent and you'll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent's doing the same to you.</desc>

		<desc>Hello Kitty comes to the Game Boy Color with HELLO KITTY'S CUBE FRENZY. The objective of each stage is simple: Kitty must collect all of the items scattered throughout each level. However, you can only tell Kitty to move left or right, and if you are not careful, Kitty will fall off the edge and say hello to the grim reaper. Luckily, blocks fall from the sky, which can be rotated and used to create staircases and bridges to the objects. However, placing three blocks with identical colors next to each other will make them disappear; this can both help and hurt. In addition to the block problems, Badz Maru, Hanamaru, and Pandaba will wander around and cause problems for Hello Kitty. Can you handle the pressure and collect all of the items in HELLO KITTY'S CUBE FRENZY?</desc>
