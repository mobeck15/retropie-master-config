		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

		<desc>Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>The objective of Asteroids is to score as many points as possible by destroying asteroids and flying saucers. The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</desc>

		<name>Atlantis</name>
		<desc>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Many game companies in the 1980's held contests in an attempt to boost sales of their games and give their fans something fun to compete for. For example, there is Activision's Enduro: Race for Riches, Data Age's Bermuda Triangle Replica Artifact, and Parker Brothers' Super Cobra Flight Jacket. Not surprisingly, Imagic also held several contests, one of which is "Defend Atlantis". Unfortunately for Imagic, there were a lot of good Atlantis players. In fact, more than four individuals maxed out the score, so Imagic had to figure out a way to decide who the top four would be. They created a special contest version of Atlantis, that they called Atlantis II, that these top scorers would use for a tie-breaker. Atlantis II is basically the same as Atlantis, except that it's faster, harder, and lower scoring. Contestants were sent a letter telling them that they qualified for this shoot off. They were to recieve in the mail the Atlantis II cartridge, along with the snorkeling set and t-shirt. According to Imagic, "We've designed this contest version of Atlantis just for you experts. Those tricky Gorgons will still thwart you at every turn, but now the battle will be more fierce and the points scored for direct hits will be less. Are you expert enough to meet this challenge and save Atlantis from the dreaded Gorgon death ray? If you're brave enough, read on." Contestants were to play the game for only two days and then send in their high scores.</desc>

Using a joystick (and a firing button to activate a laser-like weapon), the player navigates a simple maze filled with many robots, who fire lasers back at the player character. A player can be killed by being shot, by running into a robot or an exploding robot, coming into contact with the electrified walls of the maze itself, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, "Evil Otto."</desc>

Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.</desc>

		<desc>Combat is an early video game by Atari for the Atari 2600. It was released as one of the nine launch titles for the system in October 1977, and was included in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. 

Combat boasted having 27 games in one, which were all variations on the tank, biplane, and jet gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Combat Two</name>
		<sortname>Combat 2</sortname>
		<desc>Combat 2 is video game for the Atari 2600. Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.

Environments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.

The game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.

The game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the "Games That Weren't" section.</desc>

When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>

The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</desc>

There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a missile battery becomes useless when all its missiles are fired, or if the battery is destroyed by enemy fire. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.</desc>

Or of a roaring, uncharted underground tributary of the Urubamba River replete with waterfalls and deadly electric eels. "Yes," I said. He asked if I knew of the infamous, cursed Raj Diamond. Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? "Yes," I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes." "Good," said Crane. "Then you'll do it?" "Of course," I said. If only I had known...</desc>

		<desc>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</desc>

Q*bert starts each game at the top of a pyramid of cubes, and moves by jumping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.

		<desc>Space Invaders is a game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. 
The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up.</desc>

		<sortname>Breakout Super</sortname>
		<desc>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:

Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.
Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.
Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

		<desc>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Journey to the Razak Solar System and help the Yars battle an evil enemy! Super flies fight for their lives! In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however, you can temporarily hide from it in a shield that runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>

		<name>A-VCS-tec Challenge</name>
		<desc>1475. Tenochtitlán is ruled by the Aztec sovereign Axayacatl, son of Motecuhzoma. Even as he was being defeated by the Tarascans, Axayacatl was expanding his realm by conquering the Mixtecs and Zapotecs.

You, being a warrior of the Zapotecs, managed to escape the battlefield together with two of your brothers, but unfortunately your party was trapped afterwards. Axayacatl offers you the only chance to survive by reaching the coast and leaving the country by boat. He challenges you with spear throwing warriors along your path and stone rolling priests on the pyramids. Reaching the pyramids safe inside allows your team to relax for a short time and prepare for the next trail.

Simon Quernhorst, author of the Atari 2600 homebrew game Mental Kombat, has programmed a new 2600 game: A-VCS-tec Challenge. A-VCS-tec Challenge is a conversion of the popular Aztec Challenge on the Commodore 64. The Atari 2600 version of the game includes the original game's arcade-like first level, called "The Gauntlet", as well as a second level where you must race up the stairs to the top of the pyramid while avoiding large stones being thrown down from the top! A-VCS-tec Challenge features the memorable soundtrack from the Commodore 64 version, composed by Paul Slocum, author of the Synthcart and Marble Craze for the 2600.</desc>

Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your "joystick" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her. If you save her, you will be rewarded with a dirty little animation. The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.

Bachelorette Party is an "x-rated" version of Breakout. Move the Spanish fly so that the woman comes in contact with it. She will then ricochet toward the men and "score" with each one she touches. She will then bounce back toward the fly. If you miss her, you lose a turn. The fun part is watching the men's willies go up and down as she flies toward them. The roles of the men and women are switched in Bachelor Party.</desc>

These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the K’caj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet.

		<desc>Basic Math is a math game for children.

Each game gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, then inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions.</desc>

		<name>BASIC Programming</name>
		<desc>Ever wanted to try your hand at computer programming but had no idea where to start? BASIC Programming for the Atari 2600 makes programming, well, basic.

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.

To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</desc>

Using the joystick you can move your player around the court, dribble/shoot the ball, and attempt to block your opponent. The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

		<desc>Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em is an "adult" electronic video game based upon an ancient ritual
that has been passed down from generation-to-generation as part of the culture's oral
tradition.

The object of the game is to eat 'em every time he beats 'em. You score one point for
each and every drop you swallow without a miss. But should you miss, shame on you. You lose one turn. After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.

You have four turns at the outset of the game. Small squares in the lower left-hand
corner of the screen indicate the remaining number of turns at any point in the game.

You can earn "bonus turns" for every "69" points you score; however, you may
accumulate no more than 6 turns plus the one in play at any given time.</desc>

		<desc>In the animal kingdom, bees are widely known as efficient workers. But there's an interesting fact that we as humans don't know--bees enjoy having fun! Every year bees from many places gather in one spot to play in a competitive tournament of Bee-Ball! This unique insect game is a mix of tennis and volleyball where bees hit a honey ball over a net using a racquet. A bee judge watches over the match and serves new balls as needed. If the ball touches the floor or flies out of bounds, a point is scored. Avoid fouling the ball out, use your dexterity to block your opponent's shots, slam the ball to score, learn new tactics to outwit your opponent, and you could be the next Bee-Ball champion!

In the competitive sport of Bee-Ball, you must score 10 points against your opponent to win a match. You can swing at the ball to send it flying over to the net or block when your opponent is trying to get the ball past you. If the ball is about to fly over your head, you can head butt the ball in an attempt to prevent a point from being scored against you! Points are scored if the ball touches the floor or the ball flies out of bounds, but in order to score you must first successfully serve.

Bee-Ball supports single and two player play modes. In single-player mode, you compete against a challenging AI computer opponent. In two-player mode you can compete head-to-head against a friend!</desc>

		<desc>Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name. You can play alone or with up to 2 other players against the computer that takes the role of the dealer.

The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player starts the game with 200 chips and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch. He will then start with 200 chips.</desc>

		<name>BLiP Football</name>
		<desc>Did you grow up playing those handheld electronic football games? Initially released in 1977 (the same year as the Atari VCS), these portable football games became wildly popular, eventually spawning many variants. Thanks to 2600 programmers David Galloway and Bob Montgomery, you can now enjoy this classic handheld football game on the 2600 in the form of BLiP Football. Faithfully mimicked in appearance, audio and gameplay, BLiP Football recreates the experience of playing the original electronic football. In BLiP Football you control a running back and must get by the defenders trying to stop your progress! You can see nine yards of the playing field at any time--when you go beyond one edge of the field, your player wraps around to the opposite edge, showing another nine yard segment of the field. The game is comprised of four 15-second quarters. On the fourth down you can optionally kick the ball instead of running it. In addition to the default "classic mode" display (which shows red players against a black field), you can switch to an enhanced, more colorful display by pressing the SELECT switch during gameplay. BLiP Football is a two-player game, with the game controller swapped back and forth between possessions.</desc>

Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.</desc>

		<name>Blueprint</name>
		<desc>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of "Fast run time" (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</desc>

The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.</desc>

		<name>Bowling</name>
		<desc>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</desc>

		<name>Boxing</name>
		<desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

		<name>Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom</name>
		<desc>It's the 25th century.  You are Buck Rogers fighting the battle of Planet Zoom.  This is a race against death.  Your ultimate and most powerful enemy is the deadly MOTHER SHIP!

There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat.  Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS.  This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance.  Your time consumption is crucial to your survival.  

If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships.  The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it.  You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP.

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

		<desc>CANYON BOMBER GAMES

GAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.

Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.

Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.

GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. 

Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your own.  Bombs away!

GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay "suspended" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.

GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.

GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.

No "miss indicator" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.

GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.


SEA BOMBER GAMES

GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)
You're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!

GAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)
This time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.</desc>

		<name>Championship Soccer</name>
		<desc>Okay, soccer fans, the ATARI CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER ™ Team challenges you to a game. The ATARI computer team is waiting impatiently inside your Game Program cartridge for you to select one of the single player games (Games 28 through 54). They want to show you their stuff. Here’s a brief rundown on each player, just so you’ll know who you’re up against.

"CRASH" MORGAN, the galloping goalie, is the fastest man on the team. "CRASH" got his nickname because he is forever slamming into the goal posts chasing after the ball. Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears stop ringing.

NICK DANGER, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, "eat leather, chump." Don’t let his bad manners bother you, it’s just his way of rattling the opposition.

"LUMPY" DURAN, the left back, is without a doubt the clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown out of one game for toe-kicking the referee!

ALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI (Putsy), the right back. What can we say about Putsy? A real ladies man, a great soccer player, a sore loser. Even though "The Puts" has kicked and gouged his way to soccer stardom, for three years in a row he has been voted the "least likely" player.</desc>

		<desc>In the 80's, the popular commercial for Purina dog food included a dog chasing a tiny chuckwagon across the kitchen floor. Inspired by this, Chase the Chuckwagon was produced by Spectravision and released as a promotional item from the Ralston Purina Company. Buy lots of dog food and you could own this. The simple rarity of this game combined with its historical coolness makes it one of the "holy grail" games. The object is to navigate the dog through a maze in an effort to reach the chuckwagon, while avoiding the dog catcher and other obstacles. If he makes it, an animation shows the dog chasing after the chuckwagon and stopping to eat the dog food that falls out of it.</desc>

		<name>China Syndrome</name>
		<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

The player is a martial arts expert that has to liberate a hostage. The game combines two types of game-play: moving through a map, and fighting against enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of red, blue and white balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

First the troop carrying helicopters fly in dropping android paratroopers to test your defenses. Soon the sky is filled with fluttering helicopters and wave after wave of android paratroopers. They must be destroyed! Each paratrooper allowed to land on a building destroys a portion of that building. If three paratroopers land on a building. It will be totally destroyed and must be considered under commando control.

Worse still, the androids can now tunnel towards your gun emplacement. Each paratrooper who lands on that building expands the tunnel. If they are not stopped, they will plant an explosive charge under the gun.

In the midst of the battle, an aircraft may appear. It will drop a devastating bomb which can destroy all buildings and the gun emplacement. You must shoot it down or at least shoot the bomb it drops. If you miss, its back to basic training!</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Creeps</name>
		<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

Horrified, you get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site. But watch out, egg-stealing creatures are everywhere!</desc>

In Crazy Balloon you must carefully navigate your balloon through many varied levels full of different dangers. As if navigating these treacherous wasn't already nail biting, you will encounter additional hazards such as moving spikes or "Hurricane Man", who will try to blow you against a spiked wall!
Author Manuel Rotschkar (whose previous games include Seawolf, Star Fire, and Gunfight) Initially wrote this game to submit it for the 2005 Mini Game Competition, where the goal is to write an enjoyable game in the smallest space possible. Crazy Balloon includes all 16 levels from the arcade game, and you might find some surprises you're not expecting! All the obstacles from the arcade have been reproduced as faithfully as possible, with only a few elements replaced with Atari 2600 exclusive obstacles. If you're a fan of the arcade game, you won't be disappointed!</desc>

		<name>Cubicolor</name>
		<desc>You know those cheap little tile puzzles, where you shift tiles one space at a time to try to reform a picture that has been mixed up? That's what this game is like. Move the tiles on the big square (5x5) one at a time, and try to form the pattern shown on one of the little squares (3x3) within the middle 9 tiles of the big square. The game is set up with two big squares for grueling two-player competition.

Cubicolor was designed by Rob Fulop of Imagic fame. Supposedly, only 50 were produced, and each cartridge is numbered. The rarity and legend of this game make it potentially the most sought-after 2600 game in existence.</desc>

		<name>Dark Chambers</name>
		<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>If you've ever played a classic text adventure, a genre made famous by Infocom in the early 80s, then Dark Mage will be an unexpected pleasure for you. Greg Troutman managed to squeeze a text adventure into an 8K Atari 2600 cart, and although it's much simpler in execution than Infocom's offerings, it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.

In Dark Mage, you play the role of a jester banished from your kingdom and your goal is to find and return the king's black rose. As in most text adventures you explore the game world by moving through the four compass directions, find and use items and talk with characters you encounter along the way. This is all accomplished with relative ease through the use of the joystick controller, there's no typing here!</desc>

		<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.</desc>

		<sortname>A-Team, The</sortname>
		<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

		<desc>Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes.  Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos.  Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released.  Not a bad policy. 

In Thwocker, the object is to gather the musical notes in the correct order as indicated in the status area, while also avoiding the flying musical instruments. To control your bouncing character, move the joystick left or right for direction, and move it up to increase the height of your bounce. Be sure to push up just when you bounce, don't press up continuously. Press and hold the fire button to decrease the height of your bounce (push the joystick down at the same time to decrease height even faster). Once you have collected the proper musical notes, grab the large note at the top of the level. At that point, a tune will begin playing and you can now grab all the remaining musical notes, as well as the musical instruments.</desc>

You begin on the deck of an aircraft carrier. After launching, you'll come across enemy fighters. Attempt to shoot them down with one of three different missile types or your machine gun. If an enemy missile is fired at you, it will show up on radar, and you must maneuver your plane to avoid being hit. When you are low on fuel or ammo, you'll be called back to the carrier, at which time you'll have to perform a carefully controlled landing. The game continues through the night.</desc>

		<name>Tooth Protectors</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is similar to that of Activision's Kaboom!, in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In Tooth Protectors, the objects are small "snack" squares dropped by the "Snack Attacker", a menacing-looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay.

Occasionally the Snack Attacker will dive from the top of the screen in an attempt to grab the player; the player loses a turn if the Snack Attacker succeeds. If teeth begin to decay, the player can press the joystick's fire button to call in the "Tooth Protectors": an orange toothbrush, green box of dental floss and purple dental rinse bottle move across the teeth, brushing, flossing and rinsing them.[</desc>

		<desc>Ah, the Bahamas. Toyshop elves Patrick, Quincy, and Robert are laying on the beach, relaxing in the sun. Nothing could be finer than listening to the surf while enjoying a cold drink. A great reward for having gotten all of Santa's toys painted in record time. Unfortunately for you, Patrick's idea of "painting" toys was dumping them all in a bucket of gray paint. While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field, known in Japan as Hyper Olympic (ハイパーオリンピック?), is a 1983 Olympic-themed arcade game developed and published by Konami.

The arcade version was released in 1983. The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades. There were several home versions of the original; the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were only released as part of the Game, Set and Match II compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded by fans.</desc>

During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some English by moving the joystick while hitting the cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!</desc>

Tutankham is one of six games chosen to appear in the LIFE magazine photo-session conducted at Twin Galaxies on November 7, 1982, featuring video game record holders of the 1982-era, gathered for a group photograph. The Tutankham champion in the photo is Mark Robichek of Mountain View, California.</desc>

		<sortname>SCSIcide Ultra</sortname>
		<desc>SCSIcide is an original, fast-paced homebrew game released back in 2001 by Joe Grand of Pixels Past. In SCSIcide you play the role of a hard drive read head. As the different colored bits scroll by on the hard drive platter, you need to quickly read them in the correct order before you suffer a buffer underflow. As you complete each level, the data scrolls by more and more quickly! How far can you go? If you're a fan of Activision's Kaboom!, then you'll love SCSIcide.

Joe Grand has spent some time recently updating SCSIcide and has released a new version of the game titled Ultra SCSIcide. This latest version of the game contains many improvements over the original:

Added support for joystick controllers. Controller type is automatically detected when you press the paddle or joystick fire button to start the game.
Fixed the flicker that used to occur at the beginning of each level.
Changed background and data bit color palette to make bits easier to distinguish.
Reduced track size from 10 to 8 bits, for a more appropriate one byte per level.
Changed speed increase per level - only two random data bits increase in speed each level.
Modified the sound and scoring routines to account for longer gameplay and higher levels.
Changed title screen text and added GIS and Pixels Past logos.
Added a PAL version of the game.</desc>

Video Chess is a one-player game that offers eight different skill levels, including a special children's level that is appropriate for those still learning how to play.

Each player begins with sixteen pieces on opposite sides of a checkered game board: eight pawns, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, one queen and one king. One side plays with black, the other with white. Depending on the rank (with the pawn being the lowest and king highest), each piece can move across the board a certain number of spaces or in a specific direction.</desc>

The current carrot count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one of your carrots.  Your score increases every time you wallop a wabbit with a wotten egg.  It's an egg-citing experience.</desc>

		<desc>Warring Worms: The Worm (Re)Turns is a new version of Billy Eno's popular Atari 2600 homebrew game Warring Worms. This new version of Warring Worms sports several significant improvements over the original game and the game has been doubled in size from 4K to 8K. Warring Worms: The Worm (Re)Turns includes a new game selection screen, where you can see all the original options as well as several new ones:

- Tank Mode - In this mode, the snakes no longer grow continuously. As your snake moves, it no longer leaves a trail behind you.
- Solid Arena Mode - The starting arena cannot be destroyed by the cannon.
- Unbreakable Mode - Nothing can be destroyed by the cannons. In this mode, the only thing the cannon can hurt is your opponent!
- First To - Tony Morse once said something to the effect of, "Who wants to play best of 198?" This feature lets you chose the ending score, and bring "full" games down to a reasonable playable time.
- Win By 2 Mode - This feature changes the winning condition so that you must beat your opponent by at least two points.
- Select Game/Random Game - Selecting Random Game changes most of the game options to be selected randomly before each round. This provides a new challenge every round.

Think of Warring Worms: The Worm (Re)Turns as an advanced version of the classic Atari game Surround. While avoiding walls, each worm can shoot a cannon that will destroy a single block on the playing field, or kill the opposing worm.</desc>

		<name>Wing War</name>
		<desc>Wing War is a rather unique game that was only available in Europe, even though it was announced for the US market and is the only Imagic title that was not released in the US. The gameplay is a little like the classic arcade game Joust, except it's a bit more complex and involves a lot of exploration. A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies. Wing War is a very unique game, and a shame it was never released in the United States.</desc>

		<desc>Wizard is a video game created in 1980 for the Atari 2600 video game system by Chris Crawford, although it was not released until 2005. Wizard's ROM takes up 2K, the last Atari 2600 game programmed by Atari Inc. to use such a small amount.

The player plays as a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles Imps. It takes place in a maze, but it's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can.

Wizard was innovative in several ways. There was no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire was automatically sent in the direction of the player's enemy. The enemy remained invisible when it was behind a wall, making it one of the first games to implement a line-of-sight algorithm. It also had a very realistic (for the time) heart beat, which would become louder as the player got closer to the enemy.</desc>

At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.</desc>

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.</desc>

The only exception is that you can only score extra Yahtzees as a Yahtzee (some versions of the rules allow you to score extra Yahtzees as combinations less than a Yahtzee). The game control is very intuitive. You use the left joystick to play the game. From the title screen press the fire button to go to the game screen and roll the dice. The five dice are white in color which indicates they are all unselected. Pull the joystick down or move it right or left to highlight a die. The highlighted die will flash. Press the fire button to select the die. Move the joystick in any direction to move away from the die. Notice that the selected die will now be green in color. Repeat the above sequence to select all the dice you wish to keep. Now move the joystick up or down so that no dice are flashing and you have not highlighted any scoring options. Press the fire button to roll the unselected dice. You may roll the dice a total of three times. After any roll you may score your dice combination by pulling down or up repeatedly on the joystick until you have highlighted the scoring option you wish to use. Press the fire button when the appropriate scoring option is highlighted and if your dice combination is correct you will get the appropriate score. There are no take backs so be careful with your scoring.</desc>

Each round lasts two minutes and sixteen seconds; the player with the higher score after time expires is the winner, unless one player wins (and ends the game) by reaching 99 points before the time is up.</desc>

		<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>

		<name>Alien</name>
		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs).

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

		<name>AStar</name>
		<desc>AStar is a new puzzle game for the Atari 2600 by Aaron Curtis, whose first homebrew endeavor was the highly popular Fall Down. AStar is inspired by an old calculator game called DStar. The basic idea is to collect all the items (cherries on the first level), but it's not as easy as it may seem at first! You can only move in a straight line until you hit something. You can then change your direction and again move forward until you hit a wall. You also have control of a small block to that you can use to help you navigate the level.

The number of moves you've made is shown at the bottom of the screen. Each level has a minimum number of moves required to complete it, and if you go over this the display will change color. Completing every level in the minimum number of moves (no easy task!) wins the game!

Includes cartridge and full-color manual. Available in NTSC and PAL television formats, please specify above when ordering.</desc>

		<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

		<name>Dolphin</name>
		<desc>Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...

You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:

THE SEAGULL:  
Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.

THE SLIP:  
Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him "the slip".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.

SCORING:  
Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.

Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</desc>

		<desc>Double Dunk is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball. Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter "outside" man and a taller "inside" man. In a single-player game, the player controls the on-screen character closest to the ball, either the one holding the ball (on offense) or the one guarding the opponent with the ball (on defense). In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent.</desc>

		<desc>You have in your hand one of the most exciting video games ever designed. One word of caution: this game takes a little time to learn because it's so challenging. It's very tricky. So, please read these directions and give yourself some practice time. Then you can aim for the World Record.

Game 1: Straight-ahead Dragster, one or two players.
Game 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.

Your Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal. Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.

To shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.

Your car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.

When the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.

The object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.</desc>

Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

It appears that it was to be an action/adventure style game similar to Atari's classic Adventure, but given as the game was never finished, we'll never know for sure. Dune was designed by Atari programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark, but it appears programming was began by another party. This prototype appears to be only about 30% complete--the game engine seems to be done, but many of the gameplay elements and graphics are missing. Presumably this title was canceled with the Tramiels shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.</desc>

		<name>Elk Attack</name>
		<desc>With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.

Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.</desc>

		<desc>Darkness. Your head aches. Where are you? What happened to you? Then you remember the steady beep of a technical device. You start groping for the source of the tone and find a PDA laying near your legs. You grab it and watch its display.

You stare at the screen and can't tell what the numbers stand for. You stand up and move a step to the right and come to know that the small dot on the screen represents your position. You continue walking, but a wall abruptly stops your movement. You are in a giant maze and the PDA screen shows the map of this big dark surrounding!

While examining the electronic device in your hands you find a button and a small stick. Your curiosity and raising panic results in pushing the button instantly. You are still standing in complete darkness, but the screen shows something like a spotlight. It seems to be produced by a radar spot scanning the caves. Moving the small stick while the button is pressed moves the spotlight around the maze on screen. You spot ways and walls on screen and decide to follow the lanes and hope to find an exit somewhere... unfortunately you come to know that the numbers in the top right corner of the screen are counting down and you feel that it can't be any good if this timer reaches zero.</desc>

		<name>Fire Fly</name>
		<desc>TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a power plant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  

To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</desc>

		<name>Fishing Derby</name>
		<desc>This is one of the Activision video games that is fun to play even if you don't know the rules.  So go ahead!  Use your Joystick Controllers.  And when you're ready to find out why some fish bite and some don't, how to tell the whoppers from the lunkers and--especially--how to keep the shark from eating your catch, read these simple instructions.  Good Luck!

Game 1:  You against the Activision computer fisherman.
Game 2:  You against another player.

Use left Joystick Controller for fisherman on the left pier and to play against the computer (Game 1).

Use right Joystick Controller for fisherman on the right pier (Game 2). 

Move your Joystick from left to right to move your pole out and back.  To lower and raise your line, move the Joystick up and down. 

Choose your difficulty or handicap for each player (or the computer):
* A (up) - Fish won't bite unless you get the end of your line right under his nose.
* B (down) - Fish will bite if you get the end of the line near his mouth.

(Hint: When learning FISHING DERBY, handicap the computer at A, and put  your switch at B.)

SCORING:
There are six rows of fish.  From the top  down, they count as follows:              
* First two rows:  2 pounds each
* Second two rows: 4 pounds each
* Bottom two rows: 6 pounds each

The big ones are down deep.  Go for 'em!

First player to land 99 lbs. of those beautiful fish wins.</desc>

		<name>FlapPing</name>
		<desc>"The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust." ...with these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, "Otter" planted the seeds for the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong Deathmatch... but with a "Flap" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points win (3 points in a "poorlords" game).

FlapPing features two primary game variations, a "classic pong" mode which resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and "poorlords", where each player must defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!

FlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and manual designed by Dave Exton.</desc>

After programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players.  The offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or punt.  The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red controller button down, the defensive
back.

The players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by your Joystick.

GAME 2: 
In this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will follow the play exactly as programmed.  Use more strategy and try to outguess your opponent's plays.

GAME 3: 
Program in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them out.  Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.</desc>

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points</desc>

		<desc>Frog Pond is a games that Atari never officially released to the public. 2 different versions exist with this - one with a "rainbow" title screen, and one with a detailed graphics screen (most likely the final version). An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show. Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now. Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. The game has nice, clean graphics. The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad. Each frog even has its own realistic "ribbet" sound. The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue. Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out. The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B). There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions. You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit. Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects. There are five types of insects. Since the game has no manual, I created names for each type:</desc>

Coming with contact with any of these will cause them to push you off the block and into the deadly water. Once you have built your igloo, you must enter it to proceed to the next level. Remember, you must build it before the temperature drops to 0°. You have four lives.</desc>

		<desc>Monsters have taken over the ocean and enlisted the creatures of the sea as their guardians. You are FUNKY FISH, and it's up to you to rid the waters of the armies of evil! Shoot small enemies with your bubble cannon to turn them into fruit, then steal the monster's energy! But don't get too confident, the next wave is faster and nestled amid an ocean bed of obstacles! One wrong move and you're sunk! Are you fish enough to save the ocean? Funky Fish is a port of the 1981 arcade game by Sun Electronics. It was programmed by UA Ltd., the same company that programmed all the games for the Emerson Arcadia 2001. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) was never released commercially.</desc>

		<name>G.I. Joe: Cobra Strike</name>
		<desc>In the single-player mode, the player controls a G.I. Joe training camp on the bottom of the screen protected by a barrier and armed with two laser cannons. In this mode the goal is to keep the giant Cobra-operated robot snake from destroying the shield and thus the training camp by hitting it eight times. The Cobra robot shoots venom and laser beams.
In two-player cooperative mode control of the G.I. Joe training game is split between two players as they work to destroy the Cobra robot. In the two-player competition mode one player controls the Cobra robot and another player controls the training camp.
Cobra Strike was the first video game to use the G.I. Joe license. The U.K. version of the game was renamed Action Man: Action Force.

Synopsis:
"The Action Force training camp is under siege from a giant Cobra Combat Machine built by the evil Baron Ironblood. As the Cobra looms over the camp the Action Force recruits run to shelter from its vaporizing venom and piercing laser beams. Man your positions! Defend the camp! Use missile attack cannons and atomic-powered energy shields to fight the deadly Cobra."</desc>

		<desc>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel. (Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Go Fish!</name>
		<desc>Go Fish! is an original game loosely based on the Intellivision game Shark! Shark! - you are a wee fish and, to survive, you must eat other, smaller fish to grow. But watch out for the shark, as he's also on the hunt for food and you could be his next meal! Go Fish! features extensive, continuously-playing music (with an option to turn it off for those who'd rather do their fishing in quiet), as well as a two-player battle mode.

Go Fish! is one of the first homebrew games to support Richard Hutchinson's AtariVox. Go Fish! takes advantage of the AtariVox to save your high score, which is retained when you turn your Atari 2600 off. When you come back later to play Go Fish! and power on your 2600, your previous high score will be restored!

Programmer Bob Montgomery teamed up with AtariAge to sponsor a contest to create original artwork for Go Fish! The winning label from Renato Brito will grace all copies of Go Fish!, as well as the full-color manual created by Tony Morse. Go Fish! can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.</desc>

		<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

The farmer must hit the gopher to send him back underground or fill in the holes to prevent him from reaching the surface. If gopher has taken any of the three carrots, a pelican will occasionally fly overhead and drop a seed which, if the farmer catches it, he can plant it in the place of the missing carrot. The longer the game, the faster the gopher gets. The game ends when the gopher successfully removes all three carrots. There are two skill levels and is for one or two players, giving a total of four game variations.</desc>

		<desc>Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.

Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</desc>

With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

rocketing meteors and runaway satellites.  Stops at Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter
and Mars will mark your progression towards Earth.  Each one's a short
visit, though.  Then it's off again to the next planet - and the next wave
of enemies.  Reach Earth in one piece and maybe you'll think twice about
leaving home.  Then again... maybe not!</desc>

		<name>Oystron</name>
		<desc>Oystron is an action game in which the player controls a ship using the joystick controller, firing at enemies and collecting pearls dropped by "space oysters". The player's ship initially appears on the left side of the screen, and enemies attack from the right. Shooting the space oysters reveals a pearl; the player then collides with the pearl and brings it to the "pearl zone" on the left side of the screen. Other enemies appear that attempt to steal the pearls. Collecting eight pearls earns the player a bomb.[1]

At the end of each level, a boss named "Oystron" appears; the player can defeat the Oystron by placing a bomb in its path, or waiting until it changes into a space oyster. Following the appearance of the Oystron is a warp phase, in which the player travels at high speed and must avoid colliding with enemies. The player is given four ships at the beginning of a game, and earns an additional ship every 4000 points</desc>

		<name>Peek-A-Boo</name>
		<desc>The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in and out from behind a square.  Depending on the game selected the various elements of the game change slightly.  The square may be a single block, a rectangle, or four colored squares.  The cat may move far away from the square, or he may barely move half his body out.  The cat may move rapidly in and out from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square.  There are eight different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.

Before starting the game, the first thing you must do is turn the kids controller sideways to the left (so the top row read 3 6 9 #, middle row reads 2 5 8 0, and bottom row reads 1 4 7 *).  Once you have your controller in the proper position, you can actually attempt to play the game.  As mentioned above, there are eight different games.</desc>

		<desc>This is one of the more interesting Atari collectibles. Coco-Cola commissioned a game from Atari to give to their Atlanta employees. In this case, Atari redesigned Space Invaders so that you shoot the letters "P E P S I" instead of space creatures. There were 125 copies of this game made. There is no real box for this one, just a flimsy Styrofoam shell. So it isn’t really a prototype, but it wasn’t a commercially available game either. And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.</desc>

		<path>./Other/Phantom II  Pirate.zip</path>
		<name>Phantom II</name>
		<desc>Phantom II / Pirate is a homebrew cartridge featuring two games written by David Weavil. Phantom II is based on an old Bally Midway arcade game of the same name, where your goal is to patrol the unfriendly skies and shoot down enemy bombers! In Pirate, you must explore a dangerous island and find the treasure of evil pirate Chuck DeLuc! The cartridge features a menu that lets you select which game to play upon powering up your system.

Fighter Pilots Needed!

Fight your way through day and night zones and shoot down the enemy bomber!

Use the joystick to move your fighter and the fire button to fire missiles. You only get one life, so avoid colliding with the enemy jets (you are safe at the lowest level of the screen)! In the night zone the enemy jets are only visible when the radar wave passes over them.

You start with approximately 60 seconds in the guided missile version and 90 seconds in the regular missile version. If you can reach and shoot down the bomber (which requires three hits), you'll be awarded with additional time (represented by a bar on the left of the screen). The enemy jets get more evasive and you receive less time to accomplish your goals with each successive round.

Arrrrr Matey! X Marks the Spot!

Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use the joystick to move around the island and use your fire button to fight/pick up items or use an item/enter or exit the hut. The window color represents what you are presently carrying (gray - nothing, blue - shovel, yellow - sword, green - shovel &amp; sword). The color of the display in the window shows your health. You start with three hit points (3 - green, 2 - yellow, 1 - red). Snakes have 1 hit point each. The other enemies' hit points are randomly generated. There is a flower growing on the island that will restore your health, but it only works when it is fresh. Only use it when you actually need it!

The treasure is marked by an X and you must have the shovel in your possession to dig it up. Can you find the treasure before LeDuc finds you?</desc>

		<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.</desc>

		<name>Pick 'n Pile</name>
		<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>

		<name>Pick Up</name>
		<desc>This is an racy game in which you attempt to take a girl to a hotel for intimate encounters. You control the male character at the bottom of the screen, and the girl is on a platform to the left. In get to her, you must shoot various objects that are falling from the sky such as a heart, a wine glass, a car, and other items that are deemed as assets to the girl.

If you accidentally shoot the same type of item twice, you loose that item and the girl's platform drops one notch. If the platform touches the ground, you loose a life. Sometimes a falling item will flash, which means you must shoot it quickly or you will be penalized. Once you have shot each type of item once, you run over and "Pick Up" the girl and take her off the screen.

Next is the hotel screen, where you and the girl enter the hotel and close the blinds. The hotel sign then displays your "score", and level starts over.</desc>

It's actually a very simple job--at first.  You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt.  Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors.  You must stack them correctly however, or--splat!!  As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep cool, and try not to earn the dubious title of "butterfingers."

		<name>Pigs in Space</name>
		<desc>Prior to starting, players can choose which of the three mini-games they would like to play by selecting the icon for Captain Link, First Officer Piggy, or Dr. Strangepork. Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points.

Captain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.

First Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. 

The final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.</desc>

Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone.  There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.

- Chimpanzees - These little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear.  Shooting them is worth 3 points.
- Orangutans - Orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the Chimpanzees.  Touching them will get you captured and cost you 1 life unit.  Shooting a Chimpanzee is worth 200 points.  
- Gorillas - Gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes.  Not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.  Being shot will cost you 2 life units and shooting them is worth only 42 points!
 
At the top of the screen you see two counters, L and E.  L is your Life counter, you start with 60 life points and if you lose them all the game ends.  The E is your Escape counter, this is the number of times you can escape from the cage or pit.  If you run out of escapes your character will be trapped forever (effectively ending the game).</desc>

In 1978 Warner Communications, who happened to own both Atari and Ralph Lauren, assigned Carol Shaw to design a game that would tie-in with Ralph Lauren's new cologne "Polo".  It's unknown exactly how the game would be used in the promotion, but it may have been intended to be given away to customers who spent large amounts of money.  Supposedly several prototypes and handwritten instructions were sent to Bloomingdale's in New York, but nothing became of the promotion and Polo went unreleased.</desc>

		<name>Private Eye</name>
		<desc>You choose from five different cases to work, each with its own requirements. For example, the first case, "Safecracker Suite," requires you to locate the gun used in a crime and have it verified at the gun store, then locate stolen money and return it to the bank and then capture Henri Le Fiend and turn him into the police station. You have only a limited amount of time before the statute of limitations runs out and Henri Le Fiend gets away.

Hindering your investigation are a number of obstacles, including potholes, falling objects, unfriendly animals, and knife-throwing thugs, to name a few.

You drive around the city in your modified 1935 Model A, which can jump as high as two stories. It can also make 90 and 180 degree turns on a dime. When you make the car jump, you also launch yourself out of it, enabling you to nab suspects in upper story windows.</desc>

		<desc>Qb was originally written for the Atari 800 by Andrew Davie back in 1984. Many years later, Andrew decided to port the game over to the 2600, and he finished his project in March 2001. The PhillyClassic Edition, limited to 50 copies sold only at the PhillyClassic 2001, was the first release of Qb. The object of Qb is to move the blocks around in the lower frame so that they match the upper frame. You can only jump between blocks when they are adjacent, otherwise you can only push them around. Fruit appears that you can jump on for points, but watch out for the monsters. 

In early 2002, AtariAge sponsored a contest to create a label for the limited run Qb Special Edition. The winning label was created by David Exton, and you can view all the submitted labels (over 100!) as well as the contest details on the Qb Label Contest page.</desc>

		<name>Quick Step</name>
		<desc>Quick Step! is a unique take on the Q*Bert formula by adding two player action and a more frantic pace. You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life.

Occasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.</desc>

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning, but more difficult this time!</desc>

They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980’s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck! 

Rainbow Invaders is a new Space Invaders style game for the Atari 2600 from Italian developer Silvio Mogno. While many games of this nature have been released for the 2600 (to say nothing of the countless Space Invaders hacks), Silvio's game adds a breath of fresh air to the genre. Yes, you are shooting at descending waves of alien invaders, attempting to finish them off before they reach the ground. However, the aliens also periodically drop one of 16 random Special Shots, some of which will help and some of which will hinder your efforts if you catch them. Your ship also features a shield that will make you invulnerable for a few seconds, at the expense of not being able to fire again right away.</desc>

		<name>Raster Fahndung</name>
		<desc>Raster Fahndung is a puzzle game where you must locate patterns of 6 by 6 squares inside a playfield of 32 by 20 squares. Sounds simple enough in theory, but with the timer ticking down in the background you don't have the luxury of carefully scrutinizing the playfield to locate the patterns! And when you sneak a peek at the pattern (by pressing the fire button on your joystick) the timer counts down even more quickly!

The game starts with the creation of a random playfield consisting of 32 by 20 squares. Your cursor is located in the middle of the board. Push and hold the fire button to display the 6 by 6 pattern you must match on the playfield. You can use the joystick to move your cursor in all directions. Your cursor points to the top left corner of the 6 by 6 search pattern. Press the fire button when you believe you have found the correct position. If you are right, you'll receive points. If you are wrong, the required pattern is displayed again.

In a simultaneous two player game, both players must locate the same pattern, but each player can view the required pattern individually. The player who finds the correct position first receives one point. The two player game ends when the countdown timer reaches 0 or when one player manages to reach 9 points.

The left difficulty switch allows you to choose the game timing mode. "Easy / A" selects the fixed time limit per level, starting at 90 and decreasing by 5 per level until the minimum of 20 seconds is reached. All following levels offer 20 seconds. The timer on the "Hard / B" setting starts at 90 seconds and you have to find as many patterns as possible within this period.

How many patterns can you find before the timer expires?</desc>

		<name>Reactor</name>
		<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

The crowd roars after each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of "STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!" Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.

The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!</desc>

		<desc>RealSports Football is a one or two-player football simulation played on a horizontal scrolling field, with five players on each team. As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.</desc>

Each team has three players with a specific area of the field to cover. A game lasts five or nine minutes and can be played on one of three difficulty levels, with each increasing the speed of gameplay and skill of the computer players.</desc>

The computer players are challenging, and trying to line up a player under the ball's shadow can be tricky. However, two drawbacks somewhat diminish gameplay: both players must be controlled simultaneously, meaning sometimes neither player can quite reach the ball; and players can't jump to block a spike.</desc>

		<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.</desc>

		<desc>Save Mary is an Atari 2600 action game that revolves around creating platforms to save Mary, the damsel in distress. The character is a humble construction worker who must pick up crates to use as platforms to get Mary to climb up, eventually leading to the top of the valley. The villain of the story is a mustachioed fiend who keeps Mary at the bottom of the valley for his own perverse pleasure.

The player controls a crane at the top of the valley that moves picks up crates when the button is pressed. Bonus items can be picked up for extra points. The level can be restarted in the following ways:

    - The water reaches above Mary's head
    - A crate is knocked into/dropped on Mary
    - Mary is dropped from a high place.

There is no definite ending, since once all the levels are completed, the game starts over. Therefore, the game loops on into eternity.  Save Mary was in production for over 2 years, longer than any other Atari 2600 game.</desc>

Save the Whales had long been rumored to have been playable on the short-lived Gameline network, although nobody could actually remember playing the game.  Was it worth the wait?  Did it live up to expectations?  Not really.

You control a submarine that must "Save the Whales" by shooting the harpoons or nets thrown by the ship at the top of the screen.  You can choose between harpoons or nets by changing the difficulty switch, harpoons are smaller and faster than the nets so they're harder to hit.  If a harpoon or net hits your sub you'll have some damage, if you take five hits it's game over and all the whales die!</desc>

Seawolf also borrows elements from Broderbund's Seafox.

In Seawolf you command a submarine lurking below the surface of the ocean, where you need to attack enemy convoys while avoiding depth charges and other dangers. But use your resources wisely, as you don't want to be a sitting duck when you run out of torpedoes, or worse, fuel! And watch out for the Red Cross ships, as they have a surprise for you if you accidently target them!

Seawolf features four difficulty settings, with a matching color-coded score display so you can tell which difficulty setting you are playing at quick glance. Seawolf is the first Atari 2600 homebrew to feature 24 pixel wide multicolor sprites.</desc>

		<name>Secret Quest</name>
		<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.</desc>

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.</desc>

		<name>Shooting Arcade</name>
		<desc>Shooting Arcade is one of only two 2600 games to use the light gun (Sentinel was the other), but was never released.  This is a shame because Shooting Arcade is a creative light gun target game similar to the Point Blank series, and would have been unique among 2600 games.  Interestingly it appears that Shooting Arcade was not developed in the US, but rather in Mexico by a company called Heuristica.  How Axlon was invovled is unknown, but they may have simply sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves.

Shooting Arcade is really made up of six different scenes that are put together in different orders depending on the level you've selected.  Each scene has its own unique theme, rules, and objective, making Shooting Arcade essentially six games in one.  Depending on which skill level you choose, the scene's attributes change to make it more or less difficult and the timer at the bottom of the screen counts down more or less quickly.  The status bar at the top of the screen shows the number of shots you have left, your current difficulty level, and the number of targets left.  You start each level out with a limited amount of ammunition depending on the difficulty level (40, 10, 5, 2, or 1).  You can continue from the last screen you completed an infinite amount of times by simply pressing the reset button.  This is a handy feature as the game get very hard at the later levels...</desc>

		<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Skeleton+ is a 3D maze game written by Eric Ball. In order to escape this labyrinth you need to hunt down and eliminate 80 skeletons lurking about without being killed yourself! There are eight mazes, with each maze containing 10 skeletons. Complete all eight mazes and you'll gain your freedom!

Skeleton+ contains several improvements over the original release of Skeleton. The major differences are:

- Life and Kill Counters
- New Undead Locator to help track Skeletons
- Five vs Ten Skeletons per level (selectable)
- Various difficulty settings

The new difficulty settings allow you to customize the game to your liking, and maximize replay value! You can now set to start with five or ten Skeletons per level, start with 49 life and half damage, toggle the Undead Locator on or off during gameplay, and choose to have the Skeleton speed reset only at the start of a level. In addition, you can use the B/W switch to toggle "touch of death" for Skeletons.</desc>

		<desc>Use the red button on your Joystick Controller to place your
bet.  You can bet up to five coins each time.  Games 3, 4,
7, and 8 have a maximum of five paylines.  Each bet of one
coin increases the chances of adding to your bank.  For
example, bet three coins and you may win a jackpot on
either the first, second, or third paylines.

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 only "pay" on the center line (or
payline ).  In these games, the more you bet (up to five
coins) the more you can add to your bank.

After placing your bet, pull back on your Joystick to spin
the reels of the Slot Machine.  In two-player games, both
players must do this to spin the reels.  The game ends
when one player's bank is "broke".  To continue play depress
the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to each
player's bank.  (The game may end with one player going
broke, while the other player has coins remaining.  When
the game reset switch is depressed once, the player who
went broke is given 25 coins, while the player with coins
remaining receives 25 coins plus the amount left when the
game ended.)

In one-player games, you are competing against the computer.
The computer makes a random bet for each play.  The game
ends if you or the computer go broke.  To continue play
depress the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to
each bank.  As in two-player games, the player with coins
remaining when the game ends does not lose those coins when
the game reset switch is depressed once those coins when the
game reset switch is depressed once.</desc>

		<name>Snoopy and the Red Baron</name>
		<desc>The dastardly Red Baron has stolen important food supplies from the allies during the war.  Hamburgers, ice cream cones, popcorn and other tasty treats have been taken by this evil aviator and sharpshooter. Your task is to help Snoopy shoot down the Red Baron and recover the stolen supplies.

You begin your mission with four doghouses.  It takes eight direct hits to bring down the Red Baron, and for the Red baron to bring down Snoopy's doghouse.  If the Red Baron downs a doghouse, all accumulated treats will be lost.  Press the controller button to fire Snoopy's machine gun.</desc>

		<desc>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

		<name>Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.

As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.

Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.

To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</desc>

In Space Battle, you must defend a remote Earth outpost from attacking invaders! But it's not as easy as it sounds--before you can even face the enemy onslaught, you must first land your ship on the outpost's defense platform while evading an enemy sentry! Once on the platform, you will then face the first wave of enemy fighters. Can you destroy them before depleting your fuel supply? To keep your fuel from running low, be sure to pick up the fuel pods released by exploding enemy vessels! 

After you destroy the first wave, you'll then be faced with two morphing Kh'rylian Destroyers, and not only do they not drop fuel pods but they require several shots to destroy! And should you survive their fury, you won't have time for a break, as the enemies will send wave after wave of invaders to test your mettle!</desc>

You land on a mysterious planet riddled with a subterranean maze of tunnels and caverns inhabited by savage Electrosauri whose horns generate electro-molecular charges capable of disintegrating you and your crew. 

Your photon ray pistol is activated by the joystick and the fire button. The iridescent eyes of the electrosauri light the cavern walls with eerie flashes as they stalk you, their horns crackling and sizzling. If even one blast of electro-molecular energy
strikes you, your skeleton will glow inside your body as the bio-molecular compounds of your body disintegrate.

WARNING: Beware the savage attack of the shaggy marsupods.</desc>

Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used.</desc>

		<name>Sprintmaster</name>
		<desc>Sprintmaster is an action racing game similar to Super Sprint. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain. (MobyGames)</desc>

		<name>Squeeze Box</name>
		<desc>Squeeze Box is a single player, full color game designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade. There are six game variations to test your skill and judgment.

Squeeze Box is the ultimate escape game. Our pistol packin' jailbird has got to shoot like crazy to knock out an escape route through the walls... before they close in on him. The longer it takes, the faster they come, so aim carefully. But don't rush out too fast because the next room is worse, and you're getting points for each block you shoot out.

Test your endurance! Wait too long and you might touch the wall. Three touches and its all over - except for the hottest finish you have ever encountered in a video game.</desc>

		<name>Squish 'Em</name>
		<desc>It seems ridiculous - and too good to be true. Are there really suitcases full of money at the top of those unfinished buildings downtown? The ones still under construction? And those suitcases, they're just there for the taking? You would never have believed it except that the guy who told you about it, a regular union guy like you, just bought a brand new Corvette. You know that two weeks ago he didn't have that kind of money, so you guess he's telling the truth. When you asked him how come he didn't get the rest of the suitcases, he got an odd look on his face and wouldn't say another word. Strange... 

Your objective in Squish 'Em is to climb those 48-floor buildings to grab the cash-filled suitcase at the top of each one. As if scaling the heights of the buildings was not dangerous enough, you have to be alert for falling bricks from above and watch for creepy critters who've made these buildings their home! Once you reach the top of each building, you can grab the suitcase and continue to the next building. 

Along the way you'll encounter a wide range of critters that you must avoid or jump over. You can even squish the creatures with your feet, but you can only squish each creature once before they turn white with rage and pop back up, looking for revenge! Once a creature has turned white you cannot squish it again! In addition to the creatures, each building has a bonus item that you can collect to receive an extra man. 

Squish 'Em was written by veteran Atari 2600 homebrew author Bob Montgomery, who has several previous 2600 homebrew games under his belt, including Go Fish!, Reindeer Rescue, and Elevators Amiss. Squish 'Em is a near flawless port of the old Atari 8-bit computer name of the same name--fans of the original game will be pleased to see this impressive and addictive incarnation of the game on the Atari 2600!</desc>

Star Fire is a port of the 1979 arcade game of the same name created by David Rolfe and Ted Michon and released by Exidy. Star Fire is a wave-based space shoot'em-up, with several surprises that you won't find in the original arcade game. It carefully tries to not only adopt most features of the original, but to enhance the gameplay wherever possible as well.

		<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view.</desc>

		<desc>In Stargate (aka Defender II), you flies a spaceship above a long landscape, saving humanoids from alien invaders who are out to abduct and mutate them. The gamefield wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually bring the player back to their starting point.
The spaceship main weapon is a laser cannon that can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line, but also has a limited supply of smart bombs (which can destroy every enemy on the screen) and "Inviso" cloaking energy (which makes the ship invisible, being able to destroy any enemies it comes in contact with), both activated by the second controller.
A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions.
If a lander is in the process of abducting a humanoid, flying into the Stargate will teleport the ship to where the humanoid is under attack.</desc>

		<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

		<desc>Strat-O-Gems Deluxe is a new Atari 2600 game by John Payson, originally created for the 2005 Minigame Competition that bears similarities to Columns, Jewel Master, and Salu's Acid Drop. In Strat-O-Gems Deluxe, colored gems fall from the top of the screen in groups of three. Any time three or more adjacent gems of the same color line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally they will disappear. Any gems above them will then fall down; if these create new groups of three or more gems, those too will disappear, leading to chain reactions. Your job is to score as many reactions and chain reactions as possible before the gems reach the foul line. If any gems remain over the foul line after all reactions are complete, the game will end.</desc>

		<name>Strawberry Shortcake: Musical Match-ups</name>
		<desc>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>

		<name>Subterranea</name>
		<desc>Subterranea is Imagic's entry into the Defender category. Subterranea's gameplay is broken into two types of screens. The first is a side view dogfight between your ship and some hapless enemies that are trying to home in on it. Things heat up in the second (and far more common) type of screen, which consists of Defender-style action minus the humanoids. You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. 

Like Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn't appear to be very original, there's just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.</desc>

		<name>Super Cobra</name>
		<sortname>Cobra, Super</sortname>
		<desc>Super Cobra (スーパーコブラ Sūpā Kobura) is a 1981 arcade game, the sequel to popular horizontally scrolling shooter Scramble, Super Cobra was developed by Konami and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America. It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.

The game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.

Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.

The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.

The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO's while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2]

The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.

The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows

Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.
Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.
Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.
Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.
Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.
Firing rockets in a building maze.
Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.
There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.</desc>

Under the thundering surf you find an old sunken Galleon between you and your surfboard.  You only have a few seconds of air to negotiate the distance.  The Galleon is protected by fast moving octopus.  The walls of the Galleon can change shape and just in case you're not too busy, there's a jellyfish standing guard by your surfboard.  Make it back on time and you get another ride on the wild surf.

The action gets faster and faster.  You test every skill you know plus invent a few new ones, but ride the Wild Surf you will!</desc>

Your basic objective is to surround your opponent, causing him to run out of space in which to move, and at the same time not running into anything yourself. You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.

Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting. Be sure to read Section 4 to learn more about these features.

Then there's VIDEO GRAFFITI. It's just for fun without the competitive edge thrown in. VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen.

Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles released in September 1977.</desc>

The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms.

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

The FireWorld puzzle is based on the Tree of Life, with ten rooms linked together by ten rooms with doorways.  FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects.  These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld.  

Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you'll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.  As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld.  

To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues.  Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge.  These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle.

You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!</desc>

		<name>Sync</name>
		<desc>Sync is a unique collection of puzzle and rhythm games that require you to think fast and improve your dexterity to get higher scores! Sync includes seven games in total and you're sure to find several (if not all!) to your liking! Many of the games have a wide variety of settings for you to try to keep them interesting--you'll never get bored of all the variety Sync has to offer! A brief description of each game follows: 

Mantra 

The world of Mantra is a matrix, progressively populated by sequences of symbols: keep matching each symbol by reacting with the corresponding action on the joystick, until a sequence is over, and you will score points. Can you keep the Mantra alive? 

Jitter (4K) 

The matrix from Mantra returns, but this time the symbols closely resemble arrows, and you are in control of the pace of the game: as soon as you match a symbol, the control will skip to the next one in the sequence. Maintain a steady rhythm of play to score bonus points! 

Flow (4K) 

Flow is a game of balance, played inside a grid, where you have to place bars around those placed by the CPU. As soon as a running cell counter completes a given number of loops across the grid, every CPU cell whose number of bars corresponds to the sum of adjacent bars placed by the player is removed, and points are scored. Watch out for side reactions, as placing your bars to balance a CPU cell can cause a mismatch on a previously balanced CPU cell! 

Four 

Four is a compilation of four minigames: both Jitter 1K and Flow 1K are scaled down versions of the corresponding 4K games; in Gate you have to match the symbols placed by the CPU on a column that rotates vertically; and Here requires you to clear cells whenever an arrow is inside each cell. All four of these minigames offer different challenges.</desc>

		<name>TapeWorm</name>
		<desc>With Tapeworm, Spectravision gives a whole new meaning to the slithering slimes that people love to hate. According to the manual of the game, tapeworms live in bean patches, love to eat fruit and are preyed upon by other critters named Beeky the Bird, Spanky the Spider and Mystery Beetle. Uhhhh, right.
Our hero here is Slinky, a tapeworm who's patrolling the local bean patch. In order for him to get to the fruit he loves, he has to slither around the screen eating up all the beans. He consumes them by touching a bean with his head (merely a yellow square), and by doing so, another bean appears somewhere else on the screen, and then you're off again. The more beans Slinky eats, the longer he grows. Which is a problem. As you steer the worm through the bean patch, you need to take great care not to coil him back over himself because, omnivore that he is, Slinky will eat himself.

Don't tread too gingerly because while Slinky is hot after those beans, a beetle is moving across the bottom of the screen, outside the patch, bearing down on something you're supposed to believe is an apple (on later levels, different fruits take the apple's place.) Trust me when I say that it takes a great imagination to believe the block graphics resemble anything you'd find at a farmer's market. Anyway, if the beetle gets to the fruit before Slinky eats his bean, two more beans appear on the screen and Slinky has to eat them, too. Other predators include the Mystery Beetle, Beeky and Spanky. They bleep across the bean patch at random intervals. If they happen to touch Slinky's head, it's curtains for the worm.

Taken as a whole, Tapeworm isn't too bad. It borrows elements from Atari's Surround and Rock-Ola's obscure Nibbler. But what where Tapeworm fails is in its presentation (i.e. - crap graphics) and unresponsive controls.</desc>

As if that's not enough work for one bartender, try covering four different bars with a different crazy crowd in each bar.  There's the Old West Saloon, the Jock Bar, the Punk Rock Bar, and the Space Bar.

Keep the sodas coming, but not too fast.  You'd better be sure you've got a customer without a drink at the bar or the drink will slide right off the bar and no self-respecting bartender throws drinks away.  Keep your eyes open for the empties the customers sling back your way.</desc>

		<name>Targ</name>
		<desc>The locale, described by the game cabinet as "The Crystal City", is a simple 9x9 grid of roads demarcated by rectangular buildings. The player, piloting the Wummel, which looks like a small green car, maneuvers through the maze trying to shoot enemies and avoid collisions. Most of the enemies consist of angry-looking red wedges, or "Targs". Occasionally, a small cyan-colored "Spectar Smuggler" appears; shooting it scores a significant bonus. When all enemies are destroyed, a bonus is awarded and a new round starts. If the player takes too long to clear the board, the Targs's speed increases until they are traveling faster than the Wummel.

None of the enemies shoot back. Their sole means of killing the player is ramming in to him. Despite this, the game is quite challenging.</desc>

		<name>Tax Avoiders</name>
		<desc>You are John Q and you want to be rich.

In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

		<name>Telepathy</name>
		<desc>Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled.

Fortunately, this game is playable using a regular joystick controller.</desc>

		<desc>Tempest is a shooter using wire-frame graphics. Each Wireway is taken on in turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.

It was never released due to it being finished around the same time the 5200 was cancelled, it should be released around 1983.</desc>

The game is divided up into several rows (planes of existence). Between each of the rows is a portal (hole) through which you must force the Entity. This is accomplished through the careful placement of walls. The walls are moved by pressing the joystick left and right. Once a wall lines up with the portal it will 'lock' into place, thus giving the bouncing Entity no where to go but up.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. 

From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<name>Hangman</name>
		<desc>Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 are one-player games. You compete against the computer. You score one point for every Hangman Word you complete; the computer scores one point for each Hangman Word you can't complete.

GAME 1:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 2:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 3:
Playing with words from a first through ninth grade level, one player competes against the computer.

GAME 4:
Words from a first through high school vocabulary are used for competition between one player and the computer.


Games 5, 6, 7 and 8 are two-player games against the computer. After you select the game vocabulary you want to use, you and your opponent take turns selecting alphabet letters to find the word generated by the computer. Both players together are allowed 11 incorrect selections. When you make a correct letter guess, you receive a consecutive turn. The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.

GAME 5:
Two players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 6:
Two players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 7:
Words from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.

GAME 8:
Two players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.


GAME 9:
Now it's your turn to choose the Hangman Word. Instead of playing with a computer word, one player composes the Hangman Word with the Joystick Controller; the opposing player receives eleven guesses to complete the Hangman Word.

To enter your own Hangman Word into the computer, cycle through the alphabet letters on the screen while your opponent avoids looking at the screen. The Hangman Word may be between one and six letters.</desc>

		<name>Haunted House</name>
		<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.</desc>

		<name>HOLEY MOLEY</name>
		<desc>Holey Moley is an unreleased prototype written by Bob Polaro. The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.
A version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.</desc>

		<name>Home Run</name>
		<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

		<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive.

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

		<desc>Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one player game, your goal is to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer. In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

		<desc>tears across the floor of an arena, locked in combat with your opponents. But you can't just drive anywhere - there are gaping chasms in the floor, and more of the arena can fall away at any time! Worse still, you're outnumbered - two to one! Fortunately you have a special weapon at your disposal - the Kailo Sphere - which not only takes out enemies, but also rebuilds the arena floor, allowing you to span those deadly gaps.
During Combat Rounds, you must drive over glowing targets in order to spell out IXION high above the arena floor. If you survive long enough to do that, you enter a special Bonus Round where you must master the use of Kailo Spheres. Succeed, and you'll become a legend! Fail... and you'll be just another long-forgotten footnote in the epic saga of IXION.
IXION is a previously unreleased prototype (itself based on an obscure arcade game) finally seeing the light of day in cartridge form!</desc>

		<desc>James Bond 007 is a 1983 side-scrolling video game developed and published by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, ColecoVision and distributed in Japan by Tsukuda Original for the Sega SG-1000. It is the first video game to be based on the James Bond film series.

Players control British spy James Bond in his multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.

There are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, "Good luck, Mr. Bond." Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.

When a player's last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.

At the end of the game, the player also received a double-0 rating based on the difficulty of play (novice or agent), and how well the player did. If played at the novice difficulty, the maximum rating was 005, at agent difficulty, the maximum rating was 007.</desc>

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

		<name>Kabobber</name>
		<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>

Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>

The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.</desc>

		<name>Laser Blast</name>
		<desc>The object of Laser Blast is to destroy a series of land-based enemies. The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.
Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.
Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.</desc>

		<desc>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:

Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].
Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or
Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.</desc>

Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</desc>

You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>

The game uses paddle controllers, and it is the first game where each player uses two paddles to control the marble: one is used to control the vertical movement and the other is used for the horizontal. 

The goal is to navigate through each level within the time limit and in later levels, without falling off the edges. There are bonuses, hidden areas, ramps and a lot of other stuff to keep it interesting. It's got 18 levels that go from very easy to insanely hard, and several in-game songs that push the Atari 2600's sound chip to its limits.</desc>

		<name>Master Builder</name>
		<desc>WANTED: A master builder to create structures per blueprints for Spectraville. To apply, insert cartridge into Atari 2600 and power on machine.

You are shown what you are to build for 5 seconds. To get the bricks, go to either side of the screen and press in that direction. To lay a brick, press fire then down. When Spectradog comes on the screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.

Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</desc>

		<name>Maze Craze: A Game of Cops and Robbers</name>
		<desc>In Maze Craze, your goal is to be the first of two players to make it out of a maze! Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</desc>

		<desc>You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.

When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.

The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.

Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Megamania</name>
		<desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title "Astro Blaster". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "Energy" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]
If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Meltdown</name>
		<desc>Shown at the 1983 Winter CES, and listed for release in April 1983 under what was then a working title. Also mentioned in the April 83 issue of Creative Computing magazine. The game was later discovered at CGE2K4 and released by Digital Press right after the show! According to fellow Videa designers Lee Actor and Roger Hector, the game was completed under the name Atom Smasher. After deciding not to produce it, they sold it to 20th Century Fox, who renamed it Meltdown...who also chose not to release it. When the rights reverted back to Videa, they sold it to Atari, who... (surprise, surprise) never released it, and once more the rights reverted back. Historian Leonard Herman notes Cumma Technology used Meltdown (under the name Atom Smasher) with their MetaWriter display at the same show!

Watching the screen that monitors the reactor core, you notice something odd. 
An atom is beginning to throb. Uh oh, this means trouble! 
Closer inspection reveals a deadly Quark racing through the core, agitating the atoms.
It has to be stopped before it causes a chain reaction of exploding energy! 
You must line up the Stabilizing Emitter and fir cadmium rods at the hot spots. 
Hurry, the action is really heating up in there. The Geiger Counter is clicking at a frantic pace.
Already, the monitor is lit up with furious, pulsing action. 
This is your challenge – You must meet it or MELTDOWN!</desc>

		<desc>Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay of Millipede is similar to Centipede but differs mostly in enemies:

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

		<name>Mind Maze</name>
		<desc>A game based on ESP?  Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of "Mind Reading" game for its new Mindlink controller.

Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the "correct" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast...</desc>

		<name>Miss Piggy's Wedding</name>
		<desc>Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.

The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.

The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.

The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.</desc>

seize the planet of Zardon. Zardon is the last of the peaceful
planets. The Zardonians are skillful and hardworking people.
Their cities are built-up and rich in resources. It is truly a
planet void of crime and violence.

Zardon has built a powerful defense system. Several
antiballistic missile bases have been established within the
cities of Zardon. The Zardonians are ready for this attack,
and are prepared to fight to save their cities.

As base commander it is your responsibility to protect and
defend six cities on the planet of Zardon. The Krytolians have
begun firing interplanetary ballistic missiles. They are
aiming at your cities and missile bases. Your only defense is
to fire back with antiballistic missiles. But watch out, the
Krytolians are sly, they also have cruise missiles. Cruise
missiles look like satellites, but they are just as deadly as
the interplanetary ballistic missiles.

Use your antiballistic missiles (ABMs) to stop the enemy
before your happy and harmonious planet is destroyed.

		<name>Moonsweeper</name>
		<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.</desc>

		<desc>You're second in the grueling competition of an all-day MotoRodeo. Your customized truck, a cherry little number, speeds through the dangerous obstacle course. You quickly break through a brick wall, rumble through a muddy ditch, and jump high into the air. You grin widely as you land on a Plymouth, crushing it beneath the weight of your monster truck.

Up till now, you and your opponent, Trucker Tom, have been neck and neck throughout the competition, but you've just pulled ahead. Your truck paid its dues during the early part of the competition, but you're confident that you've got the skills needed to outmaneuver Tom as you race for the finish line.

Your adrenalin pounds. You psych yourself up for the few remaining obstacles. You're only slightly ahead of Tom, but there are still a few more walls and cars to crush. Good thing you learned quickly to jump the mud which is slowing Tom down.

You rev your engine, add a burst of acceleration, and jump the last mud hole as you race for the finish line. Trucker Tom has finally met his match!</desc>

Dreaming of cheese won't get you anywhere.  You're going to have to earn your lunch.  As a hungry but clever mouse, you'll have to chomp your way through a maze of corridors and doors, while avoiding starving cats who want nothing better than to eat you.  But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog!

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<desc>Off the Wall is a video game developed for the Atari 2600 video game console in 1989. It is essentially a clone of Breakout with a Chinese theme. It was developed by Axlon, a game development studio owned by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell.

Players take control of the hero Kung Fu Lu, and the objective is smash through an evil wall to kill a dragon that has been tormenting villagers. In the game, Lu receives several power-ups to achieve his goal, and he must overcome a bat that stands in his way.

Atari later released another Breakout clone into video arcades, also called Off the Wall.

Off the Wall was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on December 1, 2010.</desc>

You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Othello</name>
		<desc>You'll need strategy, foresight and cunning to be a success at this game.

The field is made up of a grid containing 64 squares.  Each player is designated by a color(white or black) and takes turns trying to capture as many squares as possible.  When you capture a square, it becomes your square and changes to your color.  Your corresponding score is displayed at the top of the screen.

To capture a square, you must OUTFLANK your opponent.  To do this, you must position your squares on the grid so that one or more of your opponent's squares is in a row which is bordered on each end by one of your squares.

If neither player can make a move the game is over.  This can occur when one player has no pieces left on the board.  It is also possible to end a game when there are blank squares on the board and both players have pieces left but there are no legal moves.</desc>

A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Symbols representing character-building qualities (the Fruit of the Spirit) are raining down from above. Stevie and Nancy need your help to collect the symbols and avoid the mischievous pudgeons... and with each gift of Love you collect, the symbols rain heavier... and faster!

This game was only sold in religious bookstores. It’s based on a line of The Music Machine products that also included LP’s sold by Sparrow. Some collectors claim to have purchased the 2600 game in a bundle with the album, but that has never been proven.</desc>
